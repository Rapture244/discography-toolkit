"""What things are called: the patterns in a folder or track name.

`layout` knows where a file sits; this knows what its name means. An
artist folder carries a count label, an album folder carries an index and
a year, and a title follows English casing -- all of it string work, none
of it touching disk.

    A thin pass to `titlecase`, which implements John Gruber's
    algorithm. It already handles the cases that need handling: minor
    words stay lowercase unless they lead, apostrophes survive where
    `str.title()` gives "It'S", an acronym among ordinary words is kept,
    a wholly-capitalized title is read as shouting and normalized, and a
    script without letter case is left alone.

    The convention is English, so a German or French title comes out
    capitalized rather than correct. No library can settle that without
    knowing the language.
